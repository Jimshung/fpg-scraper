## Configuration

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1.  Copy `config.example.js` to `config.js`
2.  Edit `config.js` with your actual configuration values
3.  Do not commit `config.js` to the repository

Note: `config.js` is ignored by Git to prevent sensitive information from being shared.
